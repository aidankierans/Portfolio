# Portfolio
A selection of the classwork and extracurricular projects I'm most proud of.
As of 9/26/19, this portfolio is incomplete, and I have at least one more project that I'm planning on uploading soon. Depending on whether it's open source, I'm also planning on adding gt.sage (so that others can see EFD in action if they want to).

# Main files
Efficient_Critical_Definitions.sage - I wrote this code in Sage in May of 2019, and optimized it over the course of the graph theory research project so that we could efficiently iterate through large sets of graphs and find the ones we cared about. It was my first time using Python and Sage, as well as gt.sage (a library of graph theory objects and functions that my program assumes is already loaded). If I were to write it again today, I'd look into Cythonizing it to speed it up further, although it served its purpose as-is well enough at the time.
